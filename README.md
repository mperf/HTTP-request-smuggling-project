# HTTP-request-smuggling-project

# HTTP-requests
Explain how does HTTP work
* What does a http request look like?
* what are the headers?
* “ok this is a simple HTTP request, execute it and tell me the response”
* basically use curl to access a website
* maybe create a simple web server that requires some headers to get 200 OK response


# HTTP-request-smuggling
intro to the vulnerability
* theory
* how can we manipulate the headers?
* How can we prevent such attacks?
* examples


### Getting started
* Along the lines of the first lab; the focus should be to learn the arguments and what happens, be careful with using tools since it can generalize the process too much.
* how to connect and set up the lab

### Learning Goals
* Could outline the core concepts that the person doing the lab should learn from it (essentially what we've learned from it)

### Troubleshooting Guide
* Could be useful

### Assignment

#### Task 1 - contact an unauthenticated page (goes through both server)
Instructions for task 1

#### Task 2 - contact an authorized page (the first server blocks the request)
Instructions for task 2

#### Task 3 - develop an attack to bypass the authentication of the first server
Instructions for task 3


#### Report
In case we want them to give written answers to something
